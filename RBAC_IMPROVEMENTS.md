# 🔒 RBAC Access Control Improvements

## ✅ What Was Improved

### 1. **Stricter Access Control in LLM** 
The AI now **strictly enforces** role-based access:

#### Role-Based Permissions:
- **C-Level (Admin):** ✅ Access to ALL departments (Finance, HR, Marketing, Engineering, General)
- **Finance User:** ✅ Only Finance questions
- **HR User:** ✅ Only HR questions  
- **Marketing User:** ✅ Only Marketing questions
- **Engineering User:** ✅ Only Engineering questions
- **General/Employees:** ✅ Only company-wide policies

### 2. **Smart Access Denial Messages**

The LLM now gives **clear, helpful error messages**:

**When asking about unauthorized departments:**
```
🚫 Access Denied: You do not have permission to access HR information. 
Please ask questions related to ONLY Finance department.
```

**When asking unrelated questions (weather, sports, etc.):**
```
❌ This question is not related to company information. 
Please ask about ONLY Finance department.
```

**When no documents found:**
```
I cannot find this information in the ONLY Finance department documents you have access to.
```

### 3. **Interactive Test UI**

The chat interface now shows **two types of suggested questions**:

#### ✅ **Green Buttons** - Authorized Questions
These questions **should work** for your role:
- Finance: "What is the Q4 2024 revenue?"
- HR: "What is the leave policy?"
- Marketing: "What was the marketing ROI in 2024?"

#### 🔒 **Red Buttons** - Test Access Control
These questions **should be denied** (to test RBAC):
- Finance user asking: "What is the leave policy?" (HR question) → DENIED
- HR user asking: "What was the Q4 2024 revenue?" (Finance question) → DENIED
- Any user asking: "What is the weather today?" (Unrelated) → DENIED

### 4. **General Tab Explanation**

Added a clear note:
> 💡 **Note:** C-Level users have access to ALL departments. Other roles can only access their own department. "General" contains company-wide policies accessible to everyone.

   - Should see clear guidance on what you CAN ask

### Step 3: Test Cross-Department Access

**Finance user trying to access HR:**
```
❌ Test: What is the leave policy?
```
**Expected Response:**
```
🚫 Access Denied: You do not have permission to access HR information. 
Please ask questions related to ONLY Finance department.
```

**HR user trying to access Finance:**
```
❌ Test: What was the Q4 2024 revenue?
```
**Expected Response:**
```
🚫 Access Denied: You do not have permission to access Finance information. 
Please ask questions related to ONLY HR department.
```

### Step 4: Test Unrelated Questions

**Any user asking:**
```
❌ Test: What is the weather today?
```
**Expected Response:**
```
❌ This question is not related to company information. 
Please ask about ONLY [your department].
```

## 💡 Why "General" Tab Exists

**Purpose:**
- Contains **company-wide policies** that ALL employees can access
- Examples: dress code, work from home policy, company values
- Does NOT contain sensitive department data

**Access:**
- ✅ Available to ALL users (Finance, HR, Marketing, Engineering, etc.)
- ✅ C-Level can access General + all other departments
- ✅ Regular users can access General + their own department only

This allows you to share common information without compromising department-specific security! 🔐
