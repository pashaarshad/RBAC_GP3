## 🔍 Week 6 Overview

Week 6 focused on **finalizing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline**, strengthening **security and reliability**, and preparing the system for **demo and evaluation**. The emphasis was on ensuring that authentication, RBAC enforcement, vector retrieval, and response generation work together seamlessly in an end-to-end flow.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of Week 6

- Finalize the **RAG pipeline integration**
- Ensure **secure authentication and RBAC enforcement**
- Improve **response reliability and confidence handling**
- Validate end-to-end system behavior
- Prepare documentation and explanations for review

---

## 🧩 Key Work Completed

### 1️⃣ End-to-End RAG Pipeline Validation
- Verified the complete flow:
  - User authentication
  - Vector-based retrieval
  - RBAC metadata filtering
  - LLM-based response generation
- Ensured only **authorized document chunks** are used during response generation

---

### 2️⃣ Authentication & Authorization Review
- Validated JWT-based authentication flow
- Ensured protected APIs are accessible only with valid tokens
- Confirmed role-based access control across query execution

---

### 3️⃣ Response Quality & Confidence Handling
- Reviewed response grounding using retrieved documents
- Integrated confidence scoring to assess answer reliability
- Defined fallback behavior for low-confidence responses

---

### 4️⃣ Performance & Stability Checks
- Reviewed query latency and retrieval accuracy
- Ensured efficient top-k vector search
- Confirmed metadata filtering does not impact performance significantly

---

### 5️⃣ Final Documentation & Cleanup
- Reviewed and finalized:
  - RAG pipeline documentation
  - Authentication documentation
  - RBAC configuration guides
- Ensured consistent structure and clarity across all Markdown files
