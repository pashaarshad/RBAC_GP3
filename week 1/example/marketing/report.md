Marketing Data Exploration – RBAC (AI/ML)
Introduction
Marketing data is critical for understanding campaign effectiveness, customer behavior, and
business growth. In AI/ML systems, such data must be handled securely. This document explores
marketing data and classifies it based on role-based access control requirements.

Objectives
• Understand marketing documentation structure
• Identify public vs internal data
• Support secure AI/ML workflows
• Enable role-based data access

Marketing Data Sources:

Campaign reports, marketing strategy documents, analytics reports, and branding documents were
reviewed to understand data variety and sensitivity.
Document Structure
Marketing documents are semi-structured and include headers, data tables, analysis sections, and
metadata. This structure supports AI-driven classification and RBAC tagging.
Public Marketing Information
Includes advertisements, website content, social media posts, and press releases. This data is safe
for external access.

Internal Marketing Information:

Includes detailed performance metrics, budgets, customer segmentation, and predictive insights.
This data must be protected using RBAC.

RBAC Role Mapping:
Admins access all data. Marketing managers and analysts access internal reports. Content teams
access creative documents. External users access only public data.

Importance for AI/ML:

Data exploration enables secure model training, prevents data leakage, and ensures compliance
through controlled access.
Conclusion
This exploration provides a strong foundation for implementing role-based access control in AI/ML
marketing systems.
