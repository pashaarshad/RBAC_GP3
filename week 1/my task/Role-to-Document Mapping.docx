# Role-to-Document Mapping & Inter-Department Analysis (RBAC)

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to analyze how documents across different departments are interconnected and to define a role-to-document mapping for the internal chatbot system. The analysis focuses on understanding relationships between Finance, Marketing, HR, Engineering, and General documents and identifying how information flows across these domains.

Based on this understanding, organizational roles such as Finance, Marketing, HR, Engineering, Employees, and C-Level are mapped to the document categories they require. This mapping ensures controlled access to sensitive information while enabling cross-department visibility for executive-level roles. The defined role-to-document mapping forms the foundation for role-based document retrieval and access control within the system.

## 2. Documents Reviewed

The following documents from the GitHub repository were reviewed to understand their content, scope, and sensitivity:

### Finance
- Quarterly financial reports containing revenue, expenses, margins, and cash flow data.

### Marketing
- Marketing reports for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 2024.
- Annual marketing performance reports covering campaign strategies, ROI, customer acquisition, and regional expansion.

### HR
- HR data files containing employee records, payroll-related information, and workforce details.

### Engineering
- Engineering master documentation describing system architecture, APIs, infrastructure, and technical processes.

### General
- Employee handbook covering company policies, code of conduct, and general organizational guidelines.

## 3. Inter-Department Interconnections

Although documents are categorized by department, they are not isolated. The analysis shows multiple interconnections across departments.

### 3.1 Finance and Marketing
Financial documents include marketing budgets, campaign expenditures, vendor payments, and return-on-investment (ROI) calculations. Marketing reports depend on financial allocations to execute digital campaigns, influencer partnerships, and regional expansions such as Southeast Asia initiatives.

This shows that marketing performance is financially driven, while finance uses marketing data to assess cost efficiency and business impact.

---

### 3.2 Finance and HR
HR data includes employee salaries, benefits, recruitment expenses, and training costs. These values appear in financial reports as payroll and operational expenses.

Finance relies on HR information for:
- Budget planning
- Cost forecasting
- Workforce-related financial decisions

This creates a strong dependency between HR operations and financial planning.

---

### 3.3 Finance and Engineering
Engineering activities require software licenses, cloud infrastructure, development tools, and system maintenance. These costs are tracked in finance documents as technology and infrastructure expenses.

Thus, engineering decisions directly influence financial expenditure, and finance must monitor engineering-related costs to control budgets.

---

### 3.4 Marketing and Engineering
Marketing campaigns depend on engineering-built platforms such as:
- Web applications
- Analytics dashboards
- Email automation systems
- Product features

Without engineering infrastructure, marketing cannot execute campaigns or measure performance. This establishes a dependency between marketing strategy and engineering systems.

---

### 3.5 HR and General Documents
General documents such as the employee handbook define company-wide policies, benefits, and codes of conduct. HR data aligns with and enforces these policies at the employee level.

This ensures consistency between organizational rules and employee management.

---

### 3.6 C-Level and All Departments
C-Level executives (CEO, CFO, Directors) require visibility across all departments, including:
- Financial performance
- Marketing growth and ROI
- HR workforce insights
- Engineering scalability and system readiness
- General organizational policies

Strategic decision-making depends on cross-department data access, making full visibility essential at the executive level.

## 4. Role-to-Document Mapping (RBAC Matrix)

Based on document sensitivity, inter-department dependencies, and organizational roles, the following role-to-document mapping is defined:

----------------------------------------------------
| Role        | Documents Access                   |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| Finance     | Financial documents                |
| Marketing   | Marketing documents                |
| HR          | HR documents and general policies  |
| Engineering | Engineering and technical documents|
| Employees   | General company documents          |
| C-Level     | All documents                      |
---------------------------------------------------

This matrix ensures that:
- Department users access only documents relevant to their responsibilities.
- Employees can view general organizational policies.
- C-Level users have complete access for strategic oversight.

---

## 5. Access Design Rationale

The role-to-document mapping follows these principles:

1. **Least Privilege**  
   Users are granted access only to the documents required for their role.

2. **Data Confidentiality**  
   Sensitive financial, HR, and technical data is not exposed to unauthorized roles.

3. **Organizational Efficiency**  
   Department teams focus on their own data without unnecessary complexity.

4. **Executive Visibility**  
   C-Level users have full access to enable informed decision-making across departments.

## 6. Conclusion

This document establishes the RBAC foundation for the internal chatbot system by clearly defining document access boundaries for each role. Through inter-department analysis and structured role mapping, the system balances security with usability.
